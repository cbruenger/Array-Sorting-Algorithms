# Array-Sorting-Algorithms

Contains the following recursive sorting algorithms:
	
	1. InsertionSort
	2. QuickSort
	3. QuickSort switching to insertion sort for arrays of a given size
	4. QuickSort-Median-of-3 switching to insertion sort for arrays of a given size
	5. MergeSort
	6. HeapSort

To run program:

	1-	Upon running this program you will be prompted to select the data type
		that you want the program to interpret your input as. Press 1 for an
		Integer array, 2 for a String array, or 3 to exit the program.

	2-	Then you will be prompted to insert a number representing size of 
		arrays for which the QuickSort algorithm will switch to InsertionSort.

	3-	Then you will be prompted to insert the elements in your array, separated
		ONLY by commas. DO NOT INSERT ANY WHITE SPACE! 

	4-	Then all of the algorithms will run and the information will be printed
		to the console. The information includes the name of the sorting algorithm,
		the duration in microseconds that the algorithm took to run, and the
		result of the sorted array.

	5-	Choose to exit the program, or select another data type and run the
		program as many times as you would like.
